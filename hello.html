  <h1>Big Tech as the Solution to a Government Shutdown</h1>

  <h3>Large tech companies increasingly take on roles government used to; they may just get more than the asked for</h3>

  <p>It’s a truism to say that Washington is broken. We may or may not be in a government shutdown when you read this, Congress sucks, and our President is an orange genius.</p>

  <p>It’s also a truism to say that when a power vacuum exists, other forces quickly rush in to fill the vacuum. When governments fail, this often takes the form of a military coup, a dictator, or populist insurgent. In the 21st century though, we’re much to distracted by our phones and feeds to latch on to the archetypal revolutionary (unless, of course, that “revolutionary” pops up in our feeds incessantly; see, supra orange genius).</p>

  <p>Now the U.S. is nowhere near “failing state” status, but Washington’s incompetence has left glaring gaps that need filling. From our crumbling infrastructure to lack of basic research funding and failure to lead in crucial areas of science and technology, increasingly America must turn elsewhere. And so we have.</p>

  <p>To use a few examples:<p>

    <ul>
      <li>Amazon’s huge and expanding logistics network and ecommerce site allow businesses large and small to tap into its platform to sell online. Over 300,000 businesses started selling on Amazon in the past year alone. The company is at the forefront of bringing drones and other next generation technologies to the market, long ago surpassing the U.S Postal Service as a delivery and logistics innovator.</li>
      <li>A simple “smart” thermometer <a href="http://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/kinsas-crowdsourced-smart-thermometer-data-now-rivals-cdc-tracking-flu-trends">has demonstrated</a> that it can track flu trends as well as the CDC.</li>
      <li>Amazon again. First Amazon announced its own municipality Bachelorette, with the winning city securing 50,000 jobs and $5 billion in initial investment. Then, Apple announced it’d be repatriating its overseas cash stash, creating 20,000 jobs and establishing an Apple campus in a new location. Meanwhile, too many states and municipalities are fighting over budgets or shutting down (looking at you, Ill. and N.J.), too busy to even think about generating the type of investment these companies can swing.</li>
      <li>Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms are the “town squares” where we go to discover news, watch Tide Pods videos, and see how everyone else is getting rich off bitcoin. Even if, as <a href=https://medium.com/@aetraina/the-facebook-fix-1aa57ff434d5>I discussed last week</a>, Facebook is backing away from its role as a news platform, Zuckerberg still has his ambition of building the “social infrastructure” needed to connect the world. And Facebook’s changes illustrate its strong desire to self regulate and avoid actual government interference.</li>

  </ul>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, large tech companies are now funding the R&D driving future technologies like machine learning, while the federal government sits <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/09/08/china-is-using-americas-own-plan-to-dominate-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence/">on the sidelines</a>:

  <blockquote cite=http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/09/08/china-is-using-americas-own-plan-to-dominate-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence/>“Annual federal funding for all computer science and mathematics R&D [at the National Science Foundation] is less than half of what Google alone spends”</blockquote>

  <p>By the way, while our government has neglected to invest in A.I., China has not. And our President seems intent on exacerbating this gap between the U.S. and China; a President that really wanted to be “tough on China” would recognize the importance of “winning” on this front.</p>

  <p>Let’s dig a little deeper into the smart thermometer example above. A digital health startup, Kinsa, has been tracking individuals’ temperatures when its smart thermometer is used, and because of the data it gathers, can now track flu trends as well as the CDC. Kinsa has received $30 million in venture funding; $17 million of this was raised last year, a mere fraction of the $11.5 billion in total private digital health funding in 2017. In fact, in 2017, total digital health funding rose above total CDC funding. These are companies pursuing machine learning in healthcare and public health, early cancer detection, and genomics aimed at personalizing care.</p>
